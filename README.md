# Visualisation
You **can** use Google Chart for visualisation since it is a simple, trusted, and well documented one.
You will find the different types of charts [here](https://google-developers.appspot.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery).
Here are examples of charts that can be usefull in our context:
- [PieChart](https://google-developers.appspot.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/piechart) to represent a proportion between measured metric
- [LineChart](https://google-developers.appspot.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/linechart) to represent a evolution, usually over time
- [ColumnChart](https://google-developers.appspot.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/columnchart) to compare different series on different metrics
- [CandleStick](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/candlestickchart) to focus on variation. [CandleStick chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_chart) is also called [Box plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot) or [Boite Ã  moustache](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo%C3%AEte_%C3%A0_moustaches) in french.

Feel free to use other charts or customise these one as long as you do that to underline what you want to show in this chart. Remember that a chart is a visual representation of results obtained in a scientific way through an experiment done to demonstrate or try something very specific. (yes. all of that.)

In the official documentation of each chart, you can hit the _'Code it yourself on JSFiddle'_ button. You will end on the JSFiddle website that allows one to test html/css/js code quickly and, in our case, see how a particular chart behave or wait as input.
